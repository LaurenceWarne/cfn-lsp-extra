* Bugs
** DONE AWS::EC2::Instance/InstanceType and other properties have very long doc which take a while to load
** DONE HTML appears in the hover of ~AWS::S3:Bucket/LogFilePrefix~ after ~Update Requries~. Also the case for ~AWS::S3::BucketPolicy/PolicyDocument~
** TODO !GetAtt completion after "." does not appear to work in lists
** TODO return_values are not parsed for some resources, for example [[https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-cloudformation-user-guide/blob/main/doc_source/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.md]]
** TODO When a property expects a list, we allow completion even without a '-' (note under the hood we don't differentiate between a property taking a List[T] or T)
